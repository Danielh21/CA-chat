        <h1>Feedback on Module 1</h1>
        
        <pre>
            
The pace on module 1 has been faster than we have been used to. 
It has been challenging and pushed us to learn fast and work hard. We generally 
think that this is good, but we are a bit worried that we will we forget some of the things 
we been through because we didnâ€™t have time to go in depth with every aspect. 

We like the very hands on approach, and it works well with the Friday exercises and 
it made sure that you had practical experience with the topics we been through. 
The help from the tutors was also great, and they are very helpful during the Friday.

The Q&A site, works fine but in the beginning you could wait a long time before 
you got a response. That got better later in the module. 
The descriptions of some of the assignments need to be clearer.  For instance 
there has been confusion about the part in the CA about the documentation, and 
how much we should document.

The instructions on the software parts, was really good. The part that helped us with Linux and Digital Ocean was a big help, and was very thoroughly descripted. 
We are looking forward to module 2!
